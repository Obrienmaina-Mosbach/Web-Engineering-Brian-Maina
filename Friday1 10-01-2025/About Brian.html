    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am <strong>Brian Maina</strong>, a passionate <em>visual designer</em> with a keen interest in technology and innovation. I hold a BA in Kiswahili and have honed my design 
        <br>expertise through impactful roles, including working at a startup and as a visual designer at SAP SE, where I contributed to creative projects as part 
        <br>of the <strong>AFRIKA KOMMT!</strong> fellowship. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong> through a dual study program, combining practical experience with academic learning to bridge 
        <br>the gap between design and technology. My goal is to leverage my creative background and growing technical skills to deliver innovative, user-focused 
        <br>solutions that address real-world challenges. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I thrive in multicultural environments, <strong>enjoy collaborative problem-solving,</strong> and am committed to continuous learning. With a blend of creativity and technical 
        <br>knowledge, I aim to contribute to impactful projects that drive meaningful change.</p>
